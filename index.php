		<h2><a href="http://dubaibritishschool.ae/">Dubai British School</a></h2>

		<p>Thank you for your interest in Dubai British School (DBS), a Taaleem School. Founded in 2005, DBS has established itself as one of the leading British schools in the region, offering a broad and balanced education to children from all around the world. We are a unique school that places the wellbeing of our students and the interests of our community at the heart of everything we do. It is our goal that every DBS student is given the tools to make a positive difference during their time with us – to their own life and to other’s lives.

<br><br>Our mission of “Enjoy, Aspire, Achieve” perfectly captures the ethos of this great school, where students thrive in a nurturing yet challenging environment – able to achieve the best possible educational outcomes and to flourish as individuals during the experience. We celebrate this individuality in all that we do, praising a musical solo as warmly as we do an A* grade and promoting a wonderful piece of artwork or sporting brilliance as much as we do an entrance into Cambridge university.

<br><br>It is this warmth of spirit that sets DBS apart, where every student, every member of staff and every parent is able to find their place in the sun. Schools are often talked about as being ‘happy places’, but DBS is made up of happy people – happy to be respected, valued, and appreciated, given every opportunity to succeed in a way that is meaningful to them. I do hope that you are able to visit the school, to see and feel this for yourselves, and to hopefully join the DBS community as a student, parent or member of staff.</p>

		<h2><a href="http://ris.ae/">Raha International School</a></h2>

		<p>Choosing the right school to bring out the best in your child is one of the most important decisions you will ever make.<br><br>

At Raha International School (RIS), a member of the Taaleem family of schools, we believe that a successful education is all about inspiration: inspired teaching to drive academic achievement, and responsible adult role modeling to encourage emotional intelligence. RIS is an International Baccalaureate World School catering for all grades from EY 1 to Grade 12, offering this internationally acclaimed curriculum respected for its relevance to today’s multicultural and increasingly global society. Our school is a contemporary and dynamic organisation, educating students from over 80 nations who collectively speak 45 mother tongues.<br><br>

Our programmes feature an inquiry approach that aligns student interest with what they learn, thereby enriching their natural curiosity and promoting a love of learning. Those with a good knowledge of the IB understand intuitively that our approach is effective in promoting the development of 21st century skills, which lead to success in life and in the workplace. Our team of internationally experienced, skilled and motivated teachers model the attributes of the Learner Profile and encourage their proliferation within our student body. A strong sense of common purpose pervades our learning community.

<br><br>I thank you for your expression of interest in Raha International School and look forward to welcoming you and your family.</p>
